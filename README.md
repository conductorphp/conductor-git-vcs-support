Conductor: Git VCS Support
===============================================

This module adds support for Git VCS in   
[Conductor](https://github.com/conductorphp/conductor-core).

## Config

This module requires no configuration. It uses the git shell command which relies on your shell user's built in methods
for git authentication. In a future release, we may update this and make configuration of authentication credentials
possible.
